/// Comprehensive iOS build command implementation.
///
/// Extends the base `Commander` class to provide a full-featured iOS build workflow,
/// including IPA generation, code signing, export method selection, and Xcode integration.
///
/// Key iOS features:
/// - IPA generation for distribution
/// - Automated code signing with certificates and provisioning profiles
/// - Supports App Store, ad-hoc, enterprise, and development export methods
/// - Handles Debug, Release, and Archive configurations
/// - Builds for device and simulator targets
/// - Validates macOS platform and Xcode environment
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final command = Command();
/// final result = await command.run();
/// if (result == 0) {
///   print('iOS build completed successfully');
/// } else {
///   print('Build failed with exit code: $result');
/// }
/// ```
class Command extends Commander {
  /// Provides a comprehensive description of the iOS build command.
  ///
  /// Returns a detailed explanation of the command's purpose, capabilities,
  /// and platform requirements for iOS application builds including IPA
  /// generation, code signing, and distribution preparation workflows.
  @override
  String get description =>
      "Build an iOS application using the specified configuration and parameters provided in the command-line arguments. "
      "Generates IPA files with proper code signing and provisioning for distribution through App Store, "
      "ad-hoc, enterprise, or development channels. Requires macOS with Xcode development environment.";

  /// Returns the command identifier used in CLI invocation.
  ///
  /// This name is used when invoking the iOS build command from the
  /// command line interface, allowing users to specifically target iOS
  /// builds within the distribute CLI tool.
  @override
  String get name => "ios";

  /// Provides the argument parser for iOS build configuration.
  ///
  /// Returns the `Arguments.parser` which defines all available command-line
  /// options, flags, and parameters specific to iOS builds including
  /// build modes, export methods, signing configurations, and target settings.

  /// Executes the iOS application build process with platform validation.
  ///
  /// This method orchestrates the complete iOS build workflow with mandatory
  /// macOS platform checking and comprehensive build execution:
  ///
  /// ## Platform Validation
  ///
  /// - **macOS Requirement**: Enforces macOS-only execution due to iOS development constraints
  /// - **Error Handling**: Returns exit code 1 if executed on non-macOS platforms
  /// - **User Feedback**: Provides clear error messaging for platform incompatibility
  ///
  /// ## Build Execution Flow
  ///
  /// 1. **Platform Check**: Validates `Platform.isMacOS` before proceeding
  /// 2. **Argument Processing**: Parses iOS-specific build arguments and global settings
  /// 3. **Environment Setup**: Validates Xcode installation and iOS SDK availability
  /// 4. **Build Configuration**: Processes signing, provisioning, and export settings
  /// 5. **Xcode Build**: Executes build process with specified parameters
  /// 6. **Archive & Export**: Creates xcarchive and exports IPA with chosen method
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - Uses `argResults` - iOS-specific argument results from CLI parsing
  /// - Uses `globalResults` - Global configuration and environment variables
  ///
  /// ## Returns
  ///
  /// Returns a `Future` that completes with:
  /// - `0` - Build completed successfully on macOS
  /// - `1` - Platform validation failed (non-macOS system)
  /// - `>1` - Build failed with specific error code
  /// - `null` - Build process encountered unexpected termination
  ///
  /// ## Error Scenarios
  ///
  /// **Platform Errors:**
  /// - Non-macOS execution returns immediately with code 1
  /// - Clear error message logged for user guidance
  ///
  /// **Build Errors:**
  /// - Missing or invalid Xcode installation
  /// - Incorrect signing configuration or missing certificates
  /// - Invalid provisioning profiles or entitlements
  /// - Insufficient disk space for build artifacts
  /// - Network issues during dependency resolution
  ///
  /// ## Example Usage
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final command = Command();
  /// final result = await command.run();
  ///
  /// switch (result) {
  ///   case 0:
  ///     logger.logInfo('iOS build completed successfully');
  ///     break;
  ///   case 1:
  ///     logger.logError('iOS builds require macOS platform');
  ///     break;
  ///   default:
  ///     logger.logError('Build failed with exit code: $result');
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## macOS Validation
  ///
  /// The platform check ensures iOS development requirements are met:
  /// - Xcode development environment availability
  /// - iOS SDK and build tools access
  /// - Code signing and provisioning capabilities
  /// - Simulator and device deployment support
  @override
  Future? run() async {
    // Enforce macOS platform requirement for iOS development
    if (!Platform.isMacOS) {
      logger.logError("This command is only supported on macOS.");
      return 1;
    }

    // Execute iOS build process with validated environment
    return Arguments.fromArgResults(argResults!, globalResults).build();
  }
